Questions
What

This projects aims to build a fast face morphing system for images and video

Why

	This project is currently being done for an academic purpose.
	However we may choose to explore one of these options in the future:
	1)Video Game Sprites
	2)Film Industry

How
	So far we have experimented with the following things:
	1) A model with 
		i) A pure Autoencoder
		ii)Autoencoder + gans
	2) Loss Functions:
		i)  Logits
		ii) Eulerian Loss
		iii)Perceptual Loss
Immediate Goals:
	1) Get it to work for videos
		 We have a timeline for the sae and an idea of how it could be made to work
Long term Goals:
	1)Once videos works perfectly. Return to the image domain and see what went wrong, Use some ideas from the video implementation we have in mind
